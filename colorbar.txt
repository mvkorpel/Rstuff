_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       x: The x coordinate(s) or other location specifier used to
          position the colorbar.  See ‘Details’.

       y: The y coordinate(s) used to position the colorbar.

     col: The colors used in the colorbar

  labels: A vector of labels to draw.  See ‘tickat’ for help on setting
          the location of the labels (each marked with a tick).  Can
          also be ‘FALSE’ for no labels or ‘TRUE’ for automatic labels
          and locations when ‘minlabel’ and ‘maxlabel’ are specified.
          Mathematical annotation is supported, see ‘plotmath’.

    tick: A ‘logical’ flag.  If ‘TRUE’, draw ticks (and labels).  If
          ‘FALSE’, just the colorbar is drawn with no extras.

   horiz: A ‘logical’ flag or ‘"auto"’ indicating if the colorbar will
          be drawn horizontally (‘TRUE’) or vertically (‘FALSE’).  If
          ‘"auto"’, the orientation will be determined automatically in
          some situations, i.e. when ‘x’ is ‘"top"’ or ‘"bottom"’
          (horizontal orientation is assumed) or when two (‘x’, ‘y’)
          points are given (the direction with the longer distance
          between the points determines the orientation).

minlabel: A ‘numeric’ value giving the label corresponding to the first
          color.  If ‘NA’, manual ‘labels’ are used if available.

maxlabel: A ‘numeric’ value giving the label corresponding to the last
          color.

  nticks: The desired number of ticks and labels.  Used when a linear
          number range is indicated by giving values for ‘minlabel’ and
          ‘maxlabel’ or when only ticks and no labels are used.  In the
          first case, the number will not necessarily match the actual
          number of ticks and labels that are drawn.

  tickat: A vector giving the tick locations on the annotation axis.
          Values between ‘i - 0.5’ and ‘i + 0.5’ cover the i:th color.
          When ‘minlabel’ and ‘maxlabel’ are specified, automatic tick
          locations are used instead, guided by ‘nticks’.

  margin: A ‘numeric’ vector of length 4 giving the margins on the
          bottom, left, top, right sides (in this order).  Given either
          as a proportion of the relevant dimension of the plotting
          region (negative value, absolute value taken) or as inches
          (positive value).  If the colorbar is placed in a corner, two
          of the margin values are used.  When ‘x’ is ‘"standalone"’,
          all four values are used.  Otherwise, only one margin is
          relevant.

longside: The size of the “long” side of the colorbar.  Given either as
          a proportion of the relevant dimension of the plotting region
          (negative value, absolute value taken) or as inches (positive
          value).  Long side means the side along which the colors
          change.  Ignored if two (‘x’, ‘y’) coordinates are supplied.

shortside: The size of the “short” side of the colorbar.  See
          ‘longside’.  Ignored if two (‘x’, ‘y’) coordinates are
          supplied.  See argument ‘totalsize’.

 axisloc: Location of annotation axis relative to colorbar.  Either
          ‘"in"’ (closer to the center of the plotting region) or
          ‘"out"’ (closer to the border).  When a horizontal / vertical
          colorbar is drawn in the middle / center, ‘"out"’ means the
          bottom / right side of the colorbar.

 reverse: A ‘logical’ flag.  If ‘TRUE’, the drawing order of the colors
          is reversed (right to left or up to down).

   xjust: A ‘numeric’ value indicating the horizontal justification of
          the colorbar when its position is given with a single (‘x’,
          ‘y’) coordinate. A value of 0 means left justified, 0.5 is
          centered and 1 right justified.

   yjust: A ‘numeric’ value indicating the vertical justification.  0
          means bottom justified, 0.5 is centered and 1 top justified.

labeljust: A ‘logical’ flag.  If ‘TRUE’, some adjustments are made so
          that the labels are justified next to the colorbar.

noaxissize: A ‘logical’ flag.  If ‘TRUE’, the size of the axis is not
          taken into account when positioning the colorbar.  When two
          (‘x’, ‘y’) coordinates are given, ‘TRUE’ means that the
          colorbar itself fills the whole space, and ‘FALSE’ means that
          the annotation axis and its labels (if drawn) consume some of
          the space.

totalsize: A ‘logical’ flag.  If ‘TRUE’, ‘shortside’ must be large
          enough to accommodate the possible annotation axis and
          labels.  If ‘FALSE’ (the default), the axis consumes space
          additional to ‘shortside’.

     ...: Arguments passed to ‘axis’

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     The values of ‘x’ and ‘y’ are interpreted using ‘xy.coords’.  This
     allows giving one coordinate point, two points (the corners of the
     colorbar) and a number of other possibilities.  For example, ‘x’
     can be a call to ‘locator’.  Alternatively, ‘x’ can be one of the
     preset locations ‘"bottomright"’, ‘"bottom"’, ‘"bottomleft"’,
     ‘"left"’, ‘"topleft"’, ‘"top"’, ‘"topright"’, ‘"right"’,
     ‘"center"’. When ‘x’ is given the special value ‘"standalone"’, a
     standalone colorbar occupies the whole device except ‘margin’.

     Additional arguments can be given to ‘axis’. For example, ‘las’
     controls the orientation of axis labels and ‘cex.axis’ adjusts
     text size.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     An ‘invisible’ named ‘numeric’ vector containing the approximate
     coordinates defining the bounding box of the colorbar and its
     axis, with components (in this order)

   xleft: x coordinate, left side

 ybottom: y coordinate, bottom side

  xright: x coordinate, right side

    ytop: y coordinate, top side

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o:

     agricol <- round(swiss$Agriculture / 100 * 127 + 1)
